%xvas:	according to Wikihow, to make au jus, start by heating some roast beef drippings in a pan over medium-high heat. then, whisk in some flour and any liquids you want to add for flavor, like red wine, soy sauce, or worcestershire sauce. next, use a wooden spoon to loosen the cooked bits at the bottom of the pan, which will add more flavor to your au jus. finally, add beef broth and let the mixture boil for 5 minutes .
